  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 29, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how user data is handled in the GarTrack app. By using the app, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>GarTrack does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information. All app data is stored securely on your device, or in your private iCloud account if you are a PRO user. The app does not require login or collect names, emails, or contact information.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Stored</h2>
  <p>The following data may be stored locally on your device or, optionally, in iCloud (for PRO users only):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Vehicle details and configurations</li>
    <li>Fuel and charging entries</li>
    <li>Maintenance logs and expenses</li>
    <li>Trip checklists and reminders</li>
    <li>Vehicle-related documents and expiration dates</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is not shared or transmitted externally by us.</p>

  <h2>3. iCloud Sync (PRO only)</h2>
  <p>If iCloud backup is enabled, your app data can be securely saved and restored via your personal iCloud account. All Apple iCloud privacy and encryption standards apply. We do not access or transmit your iCloud data in any way.</p>

  <h2>4. Ads and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>GarTrack FREE version may show banner ads provided by Google AdMob. These ads may use your device’s Advertising Identifier (IDFA) for ad delivery and measurement purposes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Upon first launch, you will be asked for consent via Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt.</li>
    <li>Ads will not be personalized unless you grant explicit permission.</li>
    <li>You can change this permission at any time from iOS Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking.</li>
    <li>For more info, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy &amp; Terms</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use or collect any analytics or advertising data ourselves. All ad-related data is handled by Google according to their privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>PRO access is available via in-app purchase using Apple’s secure StoreKit system, managed through RevenueCat. We do not collect or store any payment information ourselves. All transactions are handled by Apple.</p>

  <h2>6. Notifications</h2>
  <p>GarTrack uses local notifications to remind you of maintenance, fuel logs, or document renewals. No notification data is shared externally or stored on servers.</p>

  <h2>7. Crash Reports</h2>
  <p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to monitor crashes and improve app stability. These reports are anonymous and do not contain personal information.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete your app data at any time by using the in-app reset features or by uninstalling the app. To remove iCloud data, use the iCloud settings on your device.</p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>GarTrack is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe that a child has used the app and entered personal data, please contact us so we can assist with deletion.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Major changes will be communicated within the app. Continued use after changes implies your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns, contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@gartrack.app">support@gartrack.app</a></p>
